Based on a **Kaggle** dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploratory data analysis performed.
Algorithms used for model building are - 
* K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
* Naive Bayes Classifier
Confusion Matrices used to show accuracy of models and for comparison.

Working on the deployment..
